Imagine yourself working as a data scientist in an insurance company. Your manager asked you to come up with a data science solution to estimate the medical cost of an individual who has bought health insurance in the institution. Build a machine learning model to estimate the medical cost of an individual.

The train dataset contains seven variables including the target variable i.e. charges. These variables are:

 

age: age of primary beneficiary. (if the age is given in decimal, consider it as the nearest integer, for example, if age = 19.1, it's nearest integer is 19, if age = 22.6, it's nearest integer is 23)

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
